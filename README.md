PointCloudRegistration
======================

improved ICP for partial overlapping area situation

aim:
   this algorithm is used to registration the partiation overlapping area point cloud.
   
situation:
   this algorithm can work very well of the tunne point cloud data.
   
NOTE:
   this algorithm is not genernal purpose algorithm.
   
Requirement:
       CMKAE, PCL lib
